### Start Here
This repository contains all reference materials, background information about the world, and periodic updates of significant events that your party has encountered during your adventures in the Nelluon Triangle. Here's the structure of the information contained on this site:

- [Getting Started](Getting-started.md): This page contains essential information for the start of our mini campaign and instructions on how to create a character. 

- We will be using DnD beyond for managing character sheets. Go to this link to join the campaign and create a character shell: [DnD Beyond Campaign link](https://www.dndbeyond.com/campaigns/join/69780281190086973)

- We will be using Foundry VTT for minis, maps, and sharing images and handouts during the game. You can access our [Foundry Campaign game here](http://67.172.201.236:30000/). You do not need to concern yourself with this link for now, since the game is not populated with characters and scenes yet. But if you would like to start getting familiar with the platform, you can review the [Player Orientation page] (https://foundryvtt.com/article/player-orientation/) and look at the [Frequently Asked Questions] (https://foundryvtt.com/article/faq/) on their website.

- The [World Background](world-background.md) page contains information about the story setting of this campaign. Read through this page thoroughly to understand the context that your character will be operating in, and to get ideas for what type of character you would like to play in this game.

- Since this campaign takes place within the broader world of the Meropis Isles, relevant world details can be found in the [Meropis Isles Campaign Primer written by Matt Hale](matt-hale-homebrew-background.pdf). The details in this document are not strictly necessary for adventuring in the Nelluon Triangle, but may provide some useful context for the events happening in the campaign. 

- Another useful resource to keep track of during our campaign is the [Significant Events](significant-events.md) page. From time to time, as your party interacts with the game world, I will be logging significant world events that have happened in order to serve as useful reference material for your party to reivew if you are struggling to remember what has happened several sessions ago, as well as serve as a collection of all your significant deeds and your impact on the game world.
